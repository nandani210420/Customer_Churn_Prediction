In this project, we have built and trained a model using XGBoost and Python that predicts whether a customer will stay or churn.

What is Churn?
Churn is the measure of how many customers stop using a product. This can be measured based on actual usage or failure to renew (when the product is sold using a subscription model). Often evaluated for a specific period of time, there can be a monthly, quarterly, or annual churn rate.
